  <h1>Conclusion and Future Work</h1>
  <p>The proposed CKD diagnostic methodology is feasible in
terms of data imputation and samples diagnosis. After unsupervised imputation of missing values in the data set by
using KNN imputation, the integrated model could achieve
a satisfactory accuracy. Hence, we speculate that applying
this methodology to the practical diagnosis of CKD would
achieve a desirable effect. In addition, this methodology
might be applicable to the clinical data of the other diseases
in actual medical diagnosis. However, in the process of establishing the model, due to the limitations of the conditions,
the available data samples are relatively small, including only
400 samples. Therefore, the generalization performance of
the model might be limited. In addition, due to there are
only two categories (ckd and notckd) of data samples in the data set, the model can not diagnose the severity of CKD.
In the future, a large number of more complex and representative data will be collected to train the model to improve
the generalization performance while enabling it to detect the
severity of the disease. We believe that this model will be
more and more perfect by the increase of size and quality of
the data.</P>
