# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

* **Abstract:** Due to its lack of symptoms, chronic kidney disease (CKD), a serious worldwide health issue with high rates of morbidity and mortality, is frequently overlooked in its early stages. Machine learning models provide quick and precise diagnostic help, and early detection is crucial to slowing the progression of disease. We used KNN imputation, a technique that mimics actual medical situations, to handle missing values in the CKD dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.Diagnostic models were constructed using six machine learning algorithms: feedforward neural network, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, and naive Bayes. The best accuracy was attained by Random forest and KNN algorithms.

* **Dataset:** The dataset used in this project is focused on Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) diagnosis and contains 23 attributes. That includes id,age, bp(Blood pressure), sg(Specific gravity of Urine), bu(Blood Urine) and so on. This dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains missing values, reflecting real-world medical scenarios. The attributes are a mix of numerical and categorical data, making it suitable for machine learning model development to predict CKD.

* **Methodology:**  The methodology for identifying Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) begins with preprocessing a dataset of 400 individuals and addressing missing values using imputation techniques. The processed data was used to train five machine learning models: Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). An ensemble Voting Classifier was then used to aggregate predictions from all models that used hard and soft voting procedures to increase accuracy. Performance was measured using measures like as accuracy, precision, and F1-score, with Random Forest and KNN having the best individual accuracies. This approach proves machine learning's feasibility in CKD diagnosis, as well as its potential for larger medical applications. Also created user interface for this model for easy access for the patients.

* **Results:** he performance of the proposed models for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) diagnosis was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and F1-score. Among the individual classifiers, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) showed the best results, achieving the highest accuracy. The ensemble Voting Classifier further improved the diagnostic performance by combining predictions from all models through hard and soft voting. Additionally, the system successfully predicted CKD or non-CKD status based on patient parameters, providing a practical and accurate tool for early CKD diagnosis.
